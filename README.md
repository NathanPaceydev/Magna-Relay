# SmartWatch-Update
A Wear OS Android Smartwatch app that allows users to connect to a relay controller (or multiple relay controllers) and control the timing of the pulse signals using a slider for each channel. The app is intended for communicating with a car's CAN bus to open and close the trunk, doors and frunk of the car. The app also features a voice activation feature using a google speech to text API that automatically closes or opens the door (or trunk/frunk) from its current position depending on the user's command. Want more! The app is also available in 3 languages (German, Italian and French) and fully supports voice control in all 3.

Version 1.0 of the app was directly modified from NCD's remote relay controller app for Android and features many more items than version 2.0. These features include connecting to network devices, dynamically setting up the number of relay channels and number of relays to control. The app also allows the user to remove devices from the communications stack or add a lock pin to access certain devices. Version 1.0 is also fully supported in over 6 languages.
